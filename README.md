Developing and Evaluating Novel Machine Learning Approaches for Feature Engineering in Financial Analysis

By James Poole

This is the Python code for my MSc dissertation, which offers a comparative analysis of existing automated feature engineering methods, before utilising these tools to build a new tailored feature set for financial analysis utilising various feature selection methods. These feature sets are then fed into an interpretable machine learning stock selection system to build interpretable, high-performing portfolios from emerging markets data. The notebooks are to be run in order, apart from the final section of notebook 4 which needs 5 run before it.
